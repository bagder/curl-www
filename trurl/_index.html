<p>
<b>trurl</b> is a tool in a similar spirit of tr but for URLs. Here, 'tr' stands
for translate or transpose.
<p>
<b>trurl</b> is a command line tool that parses and manipulates URLs, designed
to help shell script authors everywhere.
<p>
URLs are tricky to parse and there are numerous security problems in software
because of this. <b>trurl</b> wants to help soften this problem by taking away
the need for script and command line authors everywhere to re-invent the wheel
over and over.
<p>
<b>trurl</b> uses <a href="/libcurl/c/curl_url_set.html">libcurl URL
parser</a> and will thus parse and understand URLs exactly the same as curl
the command line tool does â€“ making it the perfect companion tool.

SUBTITLE(Pronunciation)
<p>
 We say "trurel". As if there was an 'e' between the 'r' and 'l' at the end.
