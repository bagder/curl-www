SSL CBC IV vulnerability
========================

Project curl Security Advisory, January 24th 2012
[Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2011-3389.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

  curl is vulnerable to a SSL CBC IV vulnerability when built to use OpenSSL
  for the SSL/TLS layer.

  This vulnerability has been identified (CVE-2011-3389 aka the "BEAST"
  attack) and is addressed by OpenSSL already as they have made a work-around
  to mitigate the problem.  When doing so, they figured out that some servers
  didn't work with the work-around and offered a way to disable it.

  The bit used to disable the workaround was then added to the generic
  SSL_OP_ALL bitmask that SSL clients may use to enable work-arounds for
  better compatibility with servers. libcurl uses the SSL_OP_ALL bitmask.

  While SSL_OP_ALL is documented to enable "rather harmless" work-arounds, it
  does in this case effectively enable this security vulnerability again.

INFO
----

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2011-3389 to this issue.

CWE-924: Improper Enforcement of Message Integrity During Transmission in a Communication Channel

AFFECTED VERSIONS
-----------------

Only curl and libcurl builds that use OpenSSL are affected.

- Affected versions: curl 7.10.6 to and including 7.23.1
- Not affected versions: curl < 7.10.6 and >= 7.24.0

  Also note that libcurl is used by many applications, and not always
  advertised as such.

SOLUTION
--------

  libcurl 7.24.0 never sets the `SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS` bit

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------

  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
  preference:

  A - Upgrade to curl and libcurl 7.24.0

  B - Apply this patch and rebuild libcurl

      https://curl.se/curl-dont-insert-empty-fragments.patch

  C - Rebuild curl with another SSL library

  D - Change the option within your application by using the
      CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_FUNCTION callback

TIMELINE
---------

  product-security at Apple reported this problem to us on January 19th 2012.

  We discussed solutions and a first patch was written on the same day.

  curl 7.24.0 was released on January 24th 2012, coordinated with the
  publication of this this flaw.
