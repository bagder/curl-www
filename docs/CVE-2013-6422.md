cert name check ignore with GnuTLS
==================================

Project curl Security Advisory, December 17th 2013
[permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2013-6422.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

  (This issue is almost identical to the one named
  [CVE-2013-4545](CVE-2013-4545.html), but this problem affects a different SSL
  backend.)

  libcurl is vulnerable to a case of missing out the checking of the
  certificate CN or SAN name field when the digital signature verification is
  turned off.

  libcurl offers two separate and independent options for verifying a server's
  TLS certificate. `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` and `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST`. The
  first one tells libcurl to verify the trust chain using a CA cert bundle,
  while the second tells libcurl to make sure that the name fields in the
  server certificate meets the criteria. Both options are enabled by default.

  This flaw had the effect that when an application disabled
  `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER`, libcurl mistakenly also skipped the
  `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST` check. Applications can disable
  `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` and still achieve security by doing the check on
  its own using other means.

  The curl command line tool is not affected by this problem as it either
  enables both options or disables both at the same time.

INFO
----

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
  CVE-2013-6422 to this issue.

  CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch

AFFECTED VERSIONS
-----------------

This flaw only exists in the TLS backend that uses GnuTLS. If libcurl is built
with another TLS backend, it isn't affected.

- Affected versions: from libcurl 7.21.4 to and including 7.33.0
- Not affected versions: libcurl before 7.21.4 and >= 7.34.0

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!

SOLUTION
--------

  libcurl 7.34.0 makes sure that both options independently will cause the
  operation to fail unless the criteria is fulfilled.

  A patch for this is [available](https://curl.se/cve-2013-6422.patch)

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------

  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
  preference:

  A - Upgrade to curl and libcurl 7.34.0

  B - Apply the patch and rebuild libcurl

  C - Make sure `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` is not disabled

  D - Build libcurl with another TLS backend than GnuTLS

TIMELINE
---------

  Vulnerability reported by Marc Deslauriers.

  It was reported to the curl project on November 29th 2013. We contacted
  distros@openwall on December 3rd.

  libcurl 7.34.0 was released on December 17th 2013, coordinated with the
  publication of this advisory.
