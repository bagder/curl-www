HTTP/2 trailer out-of-bounds read
=================================

Project curl Security Advisory, January 24th 2018 -
[Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2018-1000005.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

libcurl contains an out bounds read in code handling HTTP/2 trailers.

It was [reported](https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/2231) that reading an
HTTP/2 trailer could mess up future trailers since the stored size was one
byte less than required.

The problem is that the code that creates HTTP/1-like headers from the HTTP/2
trailer data once appended a string like `":"` to the target buffer, while
this was recently changed to `": "` (a space was added after the colon) but
the associated math wasn't updated correspondingly.

When accessed, the data is read out of bounds and causes either a crash or
that the (too large) data gets passed to the libcurl callback. This might lead
to a denial-of-service situation or an information disclosure if someone has a
service that echoes back or uses the trailers for something.

INFO
----

This bug was introduced in commit
[0761a51ee0551ad9e5](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/0761a51ee0551ad9e5),

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2018-1000005 to this issue.

CWE-126: Buffer Over-read

Severity: Low

AFFECTED VERSIONS
-----------------

- Affected versions: libcurl 7.49.0 to and including 7.57.0
- Not affected versions: libcurl < 7.49.0 and >= 7.58.0

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such.

THE SOLUTION
------------

In libcurl version 7.58.0, the allocation size is corrected.

A [patch for
CVE-2018-1000005](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/fa3dbb9a147488a294.patch)
is available.

RECOMMENDATIONS
