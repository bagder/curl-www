cert name check ignore
======================

Project curl Security Advisory, November 15th 2013
[permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2013-4545.html)

1. VULNERABILITY

  libcurl is vulnerable to a case of missing out the checking of the
  certificate CN or SAN name field when the digital signature verification is
  turned off.

  libcurl offers two separate and independent options for verifying a server's
  TLS certificate. `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` and `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST`. The
  first one tells libcurl to verify the trust chain using a CA cert bundle,
  while the second tells libcurl to make sure that the name fields in the
  server certificate meets the criteria. Both options are enabled by default.

  This flaw had the effect that when an application disabled
  `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER`, libcurl mistakenly also disabled the
  `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST` check. Applications can disable
  `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` and still achieve security by doing the check on
  its own using other means.

  The curl command line tool is not affected by this problem as it either
  enables both options or disables both at the same time.

  There are no known exploits available at this time.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
  CVE-2013-4545 to this issue.

  CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch

AFFECTED VERSIONS
-----------------

  This flaw only exists in the TLS backend that uses OpenSSL. If libcurl is
  built with another TLS backend, it isn't affected.

- Affected versions: from libcurl 7.18.0 to and including 7.32.0
- Not affected versions: libcurl before 7.18.0 and >= 7.33.0

  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!

SOLUTION
--------

  libcurl 7.33.0 makes sure that both options independently will cause the
  operation to fail unless the criteria is fulfilled.

  The fix was committed, pushed and released without the full security
  implications being properly realized.

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------

  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
  preference:

  A - Upgrade to curl and libcurl 7.33.0

  B - Apply [this patch](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/3c3622b6) and rebuild
      libcurl

  C - Make sure `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` is not disabled

  D - Build libcurl with another TLS backend than OpenSSL

TIME LINE
---------

  Vulnerability reported by Scott Cantor.

  It was reported to the curl project on November 6th 2013. We contacted
  distros@openwall on November 8th.

  libcurl 7.33.0 was released on October 14th 2013, already containing this
  fix.
