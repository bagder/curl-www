curl_getdate read out of bounds
===============================

Project curl Security Advisory, November 2, 2016 -
[Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2016-8621.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

The `curl_getdate` converts a given date string into a numerical timestamp and
it supports a range of different formats and possibilities to express a date
and time. The underlying date parsing function is also used internally when
parsing for example HTTP cookies (possibly received from remote servers) and
it can be used when doing conditional HTTP requests.

The date parser function uses the libc `sscanf()` function at two places, with
the parsing strings `%02d:%02d` and `%02d:%02d:%02d`. The intent being that it
would parse either a string with HH:MM (two digits colon two digits) or
`HH:MM:SS` (two digits colon two digits colon two digits). If instead the
piece of time that was sent in had the final digit cut off, thus ending with a
single-digit, the date parser code would advance its read pointer one byte too
much and end up reading out of bounds.

INFO
----

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2016-8621 to this issue.

CWE-126: Buffer Over-read

Severity: Medium

AFFECTED VERSIONS
-----------------

This flaw exists in the following curl versions.

- Affected versions: curl 7.12.2 to and including 7.50.3
- Not affected versions: curl < 7.12.2 and curl >= 7.51.0
- Introduced-in: https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/f6433211ae9afb30ec461e

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!

SOLUTION
------------

In version 7.51.0, the parser function is fixed.

- Fixed-in: https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/96a80b5a262fb6dd2ddcea7987

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
preference:

 A - Upgrade curl and libcurl to version 7.51.0

 B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild

TIMELINE
---------

It was first reported to the curl project on October 3.

We contacted distros@openwall on October 19.

curl 7.51.0 was released on November 2 2016, coordinated with the publication
