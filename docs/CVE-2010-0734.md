data callback excessive length
==============================

Project curl Security Advisory, February 9th 2010
[Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2010-0734.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

When downloading data, libcurl hands it over to the application using a
callback that is registered by the client software. libcurl will then call
that function repeatedly with data until the transfer is complete. The
callback is documented to receive a maximum data size of 16K
(`CURL_MAX_WRITE_SIZE`).

Using the affected libcurl version to download compressed content over HTTP,
an application can ask libcurl to automatically uncompress data. When doing
so, libcurl can wrongly send data up to 64K in size to the callback which
thus is much larger than the documented maximum size. An application that
blindly trusts libcurl's max limit for a fixed buffer size or similar is
then a possible target for a buffer overflow vulnerability.

This error is only present in zlib-enabled builds of libcurl and only if
automatic decompression has been explicitly enabled by the application - it
is disabled by default.

We have not found any libcurl client software that is vulnerable to this
flaw - but we acknowledge that there may still be vulnerable software in
existence.

INFO
----

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2010-0734 to this issue.

CWE-628: Function Call with Incorrectly Specified Arguments

AFFECTED VERSIONS
-----------------

- Affected versions: curl and libcurl 7.10.5 to and including 7.19.7
- Not affected versions: curl < 7.10.5 and curl >= 7.20.0

If you build curl or libcurl to not use zlib or make your app not tell libcurl
to do this magic, you are not affected.

Also note that (lib)curl is used by many applications, and not always
advertised as such.

SOLUTION
--------

libcurl 7.20.0 makes sure that the length argument in the callback never
exceeds the documented max length.

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
preference:

 A - Upgrade to curl and libcurl 7.20.0

 B - Apply [this patch](https://curl.se/libcurl-contentencoding.patch) and rebuild

 C - Disable automatic content encoding decompression in your application

 D - Rebuild curl without zlib support

 E - change your code to use `4 * CURL_MAX_WRITE_SIZE` for buffer sizes

TIMELINE
---------

We were notified on January 9 2010.

We discussed solutions and a first patch was written and tested on January 9.

Vendor-sec was informed on January 10 2010.

curl 7.20.0 was released on February 9 2010, just before this flaw was
publicly disclosed.
