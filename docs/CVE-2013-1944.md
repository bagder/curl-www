cookie domain tailmatch
=======================

Project curl Security Advisory, April 12th 2013
[permalink(]https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2013-1944.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

  libcurl is vulnerable to a cookie leak vulnerability when doing requests
  across domains with matching tails.

  When communicating over HTTP(S) and having libcurl's cookie engine enabled,
  libcurl will store and hold cookies for use when subsequent requests are
  done to hosts and paths that match those kept cookies. Due to a bug in the
  tailmatching function, libcurl could wrongly send cookies meant for the
  domain 'ample.com' when communicating with 'example.com'.

  This vulnerability can be used to hijack sessions in targeted attacks since
  registering domains using a known domain's name as an ending is trivial.

  Both curl the command line tool and applications using the libcurl library
  are vulnerable.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
  CVE-2013-1944 to this issue.

  CWE-201: Information Exposure Through Sent Data

AFFECTED VERSIONS
-----------------

- Affected versions: all versions to and including 7.29.0
- Not affected versions: curl >= 7.30.0

  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!

SOLUTION
--------

  libcurl 7.30.0 implements the function properly and will not send cookies to
  sites just because the host names use the same tail.

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------

  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
  preference:

  A - Upgrade to curl and libcurl 7.30.0

  B - Apply this patch and rebuild libcurl

      https://curl.se/curl-tailmatch.patch

  C - Disable use of cookies or HTTP entirely in your application
