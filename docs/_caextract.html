TITLE(Automatically converted CA Certs from mozilla.org)
<div class="relatedbox">

<p>
 We provide automated conversions. The output CA bundle file in PEM format
 (250KB) is available from here:

<ul>
<p>
 HTTP from curl.haxx.se: <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem">cacert.pem</a>

<p>
 HTTPS from github: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bagder/ca-bundle/master/ca-bundle.crt">ca-bundle.crt</a>

</ul>

<p>
 The PEM file contains the datestamp of the conversion and we try to only
 convert if there's a change in either the script or the source file.

SUBTITLE(Changelog)
<p> August 4th, 2013 -
<br>
 The cacert.pem output now only contains certificates that are explicity
 marked as trusted. The script was updated in
 commit <a href="https://github.com/bagder/curl/commit/51f0b798fa">51f0b798fa</a>
 as a response to the
 <a href="http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvslog.cgi?file=mozilla/security/nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/certdata.txt&rev=HEAD&mark=1.84">1.84
 revision update of certdata.txt</a> from June
 2012. The <a href="http://p11-glue.freedesktop.org/doc/storing-trust-policy/storing-trust-existing
 .html">certdata.txt format documentation</a>?

<p> January 6th, 2013 -
<br>
 These ca cert bundles no longer contain
 the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiNotar#Issuance_of_fraudulent_certificates">DigiNotar
 certificates</a> as Mozilla marks them as untrusted and this script knows the
 markup for that, <b>but</b> it may contain related certificates that Mozilla
 (and others) would block using other means. (Like some certs that were
 cross-signed by Entrust etc). See details
 in <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/curl/bugs/1178/">bug #1178</a>.

#endif

SUBTITLE(RSA-1024 removed)
<p>
 Around early September 2014, Mozilla removed the trust bits from the certs in
 their CA bundle that were still using RSA 1024 bit keys. This may lead to TLS
 libraries having a hard time to verify some sites if the library in question
 doesn't properly support "path discovery" as per RFC 4158. (That includes
 OpenSSL and GnuTLS.)
<p>
 The last CA bundle we converted from <i>before</i> that
 cleanup: <a href="https://github.com/bagder/ca-bundle/blob/e9175fec5d0c4d42de24ed6d84a06d504d5e5a09/ca-bundle.crt">an
 older ca-bundle from github</a>.

SUBTITLE(CA cert bundle license)
<p>
 This new file is only a converted version of the original one and thus it is
 licensed under the same licenses as the Mozilla source file: MPL 1.1, GPL
 v2.0 or LGPL 2.1

SUBTITLE(The conversion script mk-ca-bundle)
<p>
 The <a href="mk-ca-bundle.html">mk-ca-bundle</a> tool
 converts <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>'s cert bundle to PEM
 format, suitable for (lib)curl and others. Writtten by Guenter Knauf.

SUBTITLE(Convert from your local Firefox installation)

<p> You can also extract the ca certs off your Firefox installation, if you
 just have the 'certutil' tool installed and run the <a href="https://github.com/bagder/curl/blob/master/lib/firefox-db2pem.sh">firefox-db2pem.sh</a> script!
