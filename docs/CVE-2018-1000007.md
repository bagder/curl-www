HTTP authentication leak in redirects
=====================================

Project curl Security Advisory, January 24th 2018 -
[Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2018-1000007.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

curl might leak authentication data to third parties.

When asked to send custom headers in its HTTP requests, curl sends that set of
headers first to the host in the initial URL but also, if asked to follow
redirects and a 30X HTTP response code is returned, to the host mentioned in
URL in the `Location:` response header value.

Sending the same set of headers to subsequent hosts is in particular a problem
for applications that pass on custom `Authorization:` headers, as this header
often contains privacy sensitive information or data that could allow others
to impersonate the curl-using client's request.

INFO
----

This bug has existed since before curl 6.0. It existed in the first commit we
have recorded in the project.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2018-1000007 to this issue.

CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials

Severity: Low

AFFECTED VERSIONS
-----------------

- Affected versions: curl 6.0 to and including 7.57.0
- Not affected versions: curl < 6.0 and curl >= 7.58.0
- Introduced-in: https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/ae1912cb0d494b48d514d

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such.

SOLUTION
------------

In curl version 7.58.0, custom `Authorization:` headers are limited the same
way other such headers is controlled within curl: they are only sent to the
host used in the original URL unless curl is told that it is OK to pass on to
others using the `CURLOPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH` option.

**NOTE**: this solution creates a slight change in behavior. Users who
actually want to pass on the header to other hosts now need to give curl that
specific permission. You do this with
[--location-trusted](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#--location-trusted)
with the curl command line tool.

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
preference:

 A - Upgrade curl to version 7.58.0

 B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild

 C - Do not enable CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION if you pass on custom Authorization
     headers

TIMELINE
---------

It was reported to the curl project on January 18, 2018

We contacted distros@openwall on January 19.

curl 7.58.0 was released on January 24 2018, coordinated with the publication
of this advisory.
