 If you find or simply suspect a security problem in curl or libcurl, please
 file a detailed report on our <a href="https://hackerone.com/curl">hackerone

<p>
 We appreciate getting notified in advance before you go public with security
 advisories for the sake of our users. We disclose security vulnerabilities in
 association with our fixes for them.
<p>
 See also the <a href="vulnerabilities.html">Vulnerabilities Table</a> to see
 what versions that are vulnerable to what flaws.

SUBTITLE(Past security audits)
<p>
  Cure 53 performed <a href="audit/cure53-curl-report-2016.pdf">a security
  audit</a> in August 2016.
<p>
  Trail of Bits performed a security audit of curl source code and internals,
  published on December 21, 2022.

SUBTITLE(C mistakes)

<p>
 The flaws listed as "C mistakes" are vulnerabilities that we deem
 are <i>likely</i> to not have happened should we have used a memory-safe
 language rather than C. The C mistakes are divided into the following areas:
 OVERFLOW, OVERREAD, DOUBLE_FREE, USE_AFTER_FREE, NULL_MISTAKE and UNINIT.

SUBTITLE(curl vulnerability data)
<p>
 <a href="vuln.csv">vuln.csv</a> and <a href="vuln.json">vuln.json</a> provide
 info about all vulnerabilities in machine friendly formats.
<p>
 Each vulnerability is also provided as a single JSON that you can access at
 "https://curl.se/docs/$CVE.json" - replace $CVE with the actual curl CVE Id.

<p>
 The JSON output follows the <a href="https://ossf.github.io/osv-schema/">Open
 Source Vulnerability format</a>
