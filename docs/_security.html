<p>
 If you find or simply suspect a security problem in curl or libcurl, please
 file a detailed report on our <a href="https://hackerone.com/curl">hackerone
 page</a> and tell.
<p>
 We appreciate getting notified in advance before you go public with security
 advisories for the sake of our users. We disclose security vulnerabilities in
 association with our fixes for them.
<p>
 See also the <a href="vulnerabilities.html">Vulnerabilities Table</a> to see
 what versions that are vulnerable to what flaws.
<p style="border: 2px green solid; padding: 6px 6px 6px 6px;">
 <b>Alert:</b> if you look up curl CVEs in public sources
 like <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov">NVD</a> you will find they
 use <i>inflated</i> severity levels and CVSS scores. They think they know
 better and override our assessments. This is a systemic error that we
 unfortunately cannot fix. Feel free to complain to them - we keep doing it to
 no use - and consider using our material as the canonical sources for curl
 issues.
