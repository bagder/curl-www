cookie leak with IP address as domain
=====================================

Project curl Security Advisory, September 10th 2014
[Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2014-3613.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

By not detecting and rejecting domain names for partial literal IP addresses
properly when parsing received HTTP cookies, libcurl can be fooled to both
sending cookies to wrong sites and into allowing arbitrary sites to set
cookies for others.

For this problem to trigger, the client application must use the numerical
IP address in the URL to access the site and the site must send back cookies
to the site using domain= and a partial IP address.

Since libcurl wrongly approaches the IP address like it was a normal domain
name, a site at IP address `192.168.0.1` can set cookies for anything ending
with `.168.0.1` thus fooling libcurl to send them also to for example
`129.168.0.1`.

The flaw requires dots to be present in the IP address, which restricts the
flaw to IPv4 literal addresses or IPv6 addresses using the somewhat unusual
"dotted-quad" style: `::ffff:192.0.2.128`.

This is not believed to be done by typical sites as this is not supported by
clients that adhere to the rules of the RFC 6265, and many sites are written
to explicitly use their own specific named domain when sending cookies.

INFO
----

Cookie parsing and use is opt-in by applications and is not enabled by
default.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2014-3613 to this issue.

CWE-201: Information Exposure Through Sent Data

AFFECTED VERSIONS
-----------------

The IP address flaw has existed ever since libcurl started to support
 cookies.

- Affected versions: from curl 4.0 to and including 7.37.1
- Not affected versions: curl >= 7.38.0

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!

THE SOLUTION
------------

libcurl 7.38.0 makes sure that when connected to a site specified with a
literal IP address, only exact matches are considered for cookies.

A patch for this problem is
[available](https://curl.se/CVE-2014-3613.patch)

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
preference:

 A - Upgrade to curl and libcurl 7.38.0

 B - Apply the patch and rebuild libcurl

 C - Avoid using cookies in your application if you ever use URLs involving
     literal IP addresses.

TIME LINE
---------

It was reported to the curl project on August 15th 2014. We contacted
distros@openwall on September 1st.

libcurl 7.38.0 was released on September 10th 2014, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.
