URL unescape heap overflow via integer truncation
=================================================

Project curl Security Advisory, November 2, 2016 -
[Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2016-8622.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

The URL percent-encoding decode function in libcurl is called
`curl_easy_unescape`. Internally, even if this function would be made to
allocate a destination buffer larger than 2GB, it would return that new length
in a signed 32 bit integer variable, thus the length would get either just
truncated or both truncated and turned negative. That could then lead to
libcurl writing outside of its heap based buffer.

This can be triggered by a user on a 64bit system if the user can send in a
custom (very large) URL to a libcurl using program.

INFO
----

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2016-8622 to this issue.

CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow

AFFECTED VERSIONS
-----------------

This flaw exists in the following curl versions

- Affected versions: curl 7.24.0 to and including 7.50.3
- Not affected versions: curl < 7.24.0 and curl >= 7.51.0
- Introduced-in: https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/75ca568fa1

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!

SOLUTION
------------

In version 7.51.0, the parser function is fixed.

- Fixed-in: https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/53e71e47d6b81650d26ec33a5

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
preference:

 A - Upgrade curl and libcurl to version 7.51.0

 B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild

TIMELINE
---------

It was first reported to the curl project on September 23 by Cure53.

We contacted distros@openwall on October 19.
