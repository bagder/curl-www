Project curl Security Dismissal, August 26 2023 -
[Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-52071.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

None. CVE-2023-52071 was filed and made public by an anonymous person due to
incompetence or malice. We cannot say which and the distinction does not
matter to us.

The original description said:

`tiny-curl-8_4_0`, `curl-8_4_0` and `curl-8_5_0` were discovered to contain an
off-by-one out-of-bounds array index via the component `tool_cb_wrt`.

INFO
----

CVE-2023-52071 was published on January 30 2024. Its existence was reported to
us the same day.

The CVE references a git commit that fixes an assert. The assert itself
accesses a stack based buffer one byte out of boundary. This code is only
included in debug builds and never in release-builds. Even in debug builds it
is not a security problem.

The bug in question was introduced in
[af3f4e419b9f3397](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/af3f4e419b9f3397)
(April 4 2023, shipped in 8.3.0), fixed in
[73980f9ace6c7577e7](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/73980f9ace6c7577e7)
(September 13 2023, shipped in 8.4.0).

AFFECTED VERSIONS
-----------------

It does not affect any version. It is not a security problem. It was a bug
that we fixed in September 2023.

SOLUTION
------------

Relax. Use curl as usual.

The curl security team will work on getting this CVE rejected.

RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------

Do not blindly trust the CVE system. It is full of cracks and bogus reports
such as CVE-2023-52071.
 
TIMELINE
--------
