 In the cURL project we've been using CVS since the start of the project, and
 around its 12th birthday (March 20, 2010) we started converting over to the
 new git repository. The transition is still incomplete!

TITLE(<b>Browse</b> the Sources)
<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/bagder/curl">Browse the source repository</a> (on github.com)

TITLE(<b>Get</b> the Sources)
<p>
  The curl sources are kept in a git repository. You can get the most recent
  curl source files from there at any time. git is the version control system
  we use for the curl project. All files in the release archive that aren't
  generated from other files are kept there, to allow full backtracking of
  older versions. To use git you need a git client, get yours from <a
  href="https://git-scm.com/">git-scm.com</a>.  Windows users might
  fancy <a href="https://tortoisegit.org/">tortoisegit</a> or <a
  href="https://git-for-windows.github.io/">msysgit</a>.
<p>
  This is mostly a feature for you who really want to have a peek in how the
  current development version looks like, and not if you just want to download
  a version to run. If you just want to download a tar or binary archive, <a
  href="download.html">go here</a>.
<p>
  If you want to use the git server, run:
<pre>
  git clone https://github.com/bagder/curl.git
</pre>

  or use the Swedish mirror server:

<pre>
  git clone git://curl.haxx.se/curl
</pre>

 <b>Note</b> that this will create a curl subdirectory.
<p>
  If you at a later time want to get the updated set of files, just cd into
  this directory and run
<pre>
  git pull
</pre>
<p>
  If a proxy, firewall or something else is preventing you from using git to
  get the latest sources, you can get the sources off the repo using HTTP like:
<pre>
  git clone https://github.com/bagder/curl.git
</pre>
 You can also opt to download a <a
 href="http://cool.haxx.se/curl-daily/">daily snapshot</a>.

TITLE(<b>Compile and Build</b> the Sources)
<p>
 When you checkout the sources, you get a file named CVS-INFO in the source
 root that describes how to proceed to compile and build them.

TITLE(<b>Change</b> the Sources)
<p>
 If you are about to do a lot of modifications, discuss it on the curl or
 libcurl mailing list in advance and please consider to use git directly to do
 the changes and provide the necessary patches back to the project!

<p>
 If you want to push to the repository, you need to have it cloned using:
<pre>
  git clone git@github.com:bagder/curl.git
</pre>
<p>
 This also requires that you have a github account and have been added to the
 project as a collaborator by Daniel.
