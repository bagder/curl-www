# curl-www

This is (most of) the curl.se web site contents. It mostly builds static
HTML files that are preprocessed.

## Prerequisites

The web site is a on old custom made setup that mostly builds static HTML
files from a set of source files. The sources files are preprocessed with what
is basically a souped-up C preprocessor called `fcpp` and a set of perl
scripts. The man pages get converted to HTML with roffit. Make sure fcpp,
perl, roffit, make and curl are all in your $PATH. Also be sure to use
GNU coreutils and GNU make when building.

# Build

Once you've cloned the git repo the first time, invoke `sh bootstrap.sh` once
to get a symlink and some some initial local files setup, and then you can
build the web site locally by invoking make in the source root tree.

Note that this doesn't make you a complete web site mirror, as some scripts
and files are only available on the real actual site, but should give you
enough to let you load most HTML pages locally.
