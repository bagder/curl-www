TITLE(Make a Donation to the curl Project)
<p>
 DONATE
<p>
 If you use curl a lot and like it, or perhaps your company makes money from
 curl or curl-related activities, why not support the project with a donation?
<p>
 Donations made to this (when you press the button above) paypal account go to
 Daniel Stenberg, head of the curl project and main author. Daniel will keep
 track of the money and spend them on suitable curl-related activities.
