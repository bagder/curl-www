  While the feature window is <b>open</b>, we allow merging new features and
  changes. Normally, the feature window is open from the Monday following a
  release until the Wednesday four weeks before a pending release.

<p>
  While the feature window is <b>closed</b>, we do not allow merging new
  features or changes and only merge bug-fixes.

<p>
  You can still submit pull-requests for new features when the window is closed,
  but they will not be merged until the window opens again.
