# curl-www

This is (most of) the curl.se web site contents. It mostly builds static
HTML files that are preprocessed.

## Prerequisites

The web site is a on old custom made setup that mostly builds static HTML
files from a set of source files using (GNU) `make`. The sources files are
preprocessed with what is basically a souped-up C preprocessor called `fcpp`
and a set of `perl` scripts. The man pages get converted to HTML with
`roffit`.

Markdown is converted to HTML with `pandoc`.

Make sure the following tools are in your $PATH.

 - curl
 - [fcpp](https://daniel.haxx.se/projects/fcpp/)
 - GNU make
 - pandoc
 - perl (with CPAN packages: CGI, HTML::Entities)
 - roffit
 - GNU ln
 - GNU date

# Build

Once you've cloned the Git repo the first time, invoke `sh bootstrap.sh` once
to get a symlink and some some initial local files setup, and then you can
build the web site locally by invoking make in the source root tree.

Note that this doesn't make you a complete web site mirror, as some scripts
and files are only available on the real actual site, but should give you
enough to let you load most HTML pages locally.
