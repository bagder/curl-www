<p>
 On December 19
 2017, <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/virtualization/2017/12/19/tar-and-curl-come-to-windows/">Microsoft
 announced</a> that since insider build 17063 of Windows 10, curl is a default
 component.

SUBTITLE(Windows 10/11 bundle curl)
<p>
 All installs of Microsoft Windows 10 and Windows 11 get curl installed by
 default since then. The initial curl version Microsoft shipped was 7.55.1 but
 it was upgraded to 7.79.1 in January 2022.
<p>
 The Microsoft provided version is built to use the Schannel TLS backend.
 Invoking curl -V shows this on these platforms:
<p>
<pre>
curl 7.79.1 (Windows) libcurl/7.79.1 Schannel
Release-Date: 2021-09-22
Protocols: dict file ftp ftps http https imap imaps pop3 pop3s smtp smtps telnet tftp
Features: AsynchDNS HSTS IPv6 Kerberos Largefile NTLM SPNEGO SSL SSPI UnixSockets
</pre>

SUBTITLE(Separate)
<p>
 The curl tool shipped with Windows is built by and handled by Microsoft. It
 is a separate build that will have different features and capabilities
 enabled and disabled compared to the <a href="/windows/">Windows builds</a>
 offered by the curl project. They do however build curl from the same source
 code. If you have problems with their curl version, report that to them.
<p>
 You can probably assume that the curl packages from Microsoft will always lag
 behind the versions provided by the curl project itself.

SUBTITLE(A Powershell alias)
<p>
 The curl tool comes installed <i>in addition to</i> the
 dreaded <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2016/08/19/removing-the-powershell-curl-alias/">curl
 alias</a> that plagues Powershell users since it is an alias that runs the
 invoke-webrequest command and therefore isn't acting much like curl at all.
