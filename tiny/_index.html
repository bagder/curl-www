TITLE(tiny-curl)
<p>
  <b>tiny-curl is curl for smaller systems</b>.

  <ul>
    <li> focused on providing a library for HTTP(S) GET
    <li> provides the familiar and known libcurl API
    <li> targets RTOSes and systems "too small to run regular Linux"
    <li> provides ports to RTOSes that "real curl" don't support: FreeRTOS and Micrium so far
    <li> GPLv3 licensed
  </ul>

<p>
  All features that tiny-curl disable by default are possible to enable,
  piecemeal, but might increase footprint and memory requirements.

<p>
  As many as possible of the mechanisms that are done to shrink the footprint
  for tiny-curl are backported and merged into real curl.

SUBTITLE(Size requirements)
<p>
  The goal of tiny-curl is to offer HTTPS GET powers within <b>100K of storage
  size</b> (on a 32 bit system), and that includes wolfSSL.
<p>
  tiny-curl itself requires about <b>20K of dynamic memory</b> (but using more
  may speed up transfers).

SUBTITLE(License)
<p>
  tiny-curl is licensed under GPLv3. Note that this is different than the
  regular curl, which is MIT licensed.
<p>
  You can also get <a href="https://www.wolfssl.com/contact/">tiny-curl under
