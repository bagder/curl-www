TITLE(Everything curl - the book)
<p>
  <i>Everything curl</i> is an extensive, detailed and totally free book,
  available in multiple formats.

<p>
  Learn how to use curl. How to use libcurl. How to build them from source or
  perhaps how the curl project accepts contributions. There's something for
  everyone in this, from the casual first-time users to the experienced
  libcurl hackers.
<p>
  Everything curl is written by Daniel Stenberg but is also itself an open
  project that accepts your contributions and help.
