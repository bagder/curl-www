<p>
Free Software and Open Source projects have a long tradition of forks and
duplicate efforts. We enjoy "doing it ourselves", no matter if someone else
has done something very similar already.

<p>
 Alternative libraries that cover parts of libcurl's features:

<p>
<b><a href="./">libcurl</a></b> (MIT)<br>
<ul>
  a highly portable and easy-to-use client-side URL transfer library,
  supporting DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP,
  LDAPS, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET and TFTP.
  libcurl also supports HTTPS certificates, HTTP POST, HTTP PUT, FTP
  uploading, kerberos, HTTP form based upload, proxies, cookies, user+password
  authentication, file transfer resume, http proxy tunnelling and more!
</ul>

<p>
<b>libghttp</b> (LGPL)<br>
<ul>
  Having a glance at libghttp (a gnome http library), it looks as if it works
  rather similar to libcurl (for http). There's no web page for this and the
  person who's email is mentioned in the README of the latest release I found
  claims he has passed the leadership of the project to "eazel". Popular
  choice among GNOME projects.
</ul>
<b><a href="https://www.w3.org/Library/">libwww</a></b> (<a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-software-20021231">W3C license</a>) <a href="libwww.html">comparison with libcurl</a> <br>
<ul>
  More complex and harder to use than libcurl is. Includes everything
  from multi-threading to HTML parsing. The most notable transfer-related
  feature that libcurl does not offer but libwww does, is caching.
</ul>

<b><a href="http://www.westga.edu/~stu7440/projects/ferit.html">libferit</a></b> (GPL)<br>
<ul>
  C++ library "for transferring files via http, ftp, gopher, proxy server".
  Based on 'snarf' 2.0.9-code (formerly known as libsnarf).  Quote from
  freshmeat: <i>"As the author of snarf, I have to say this frightens
  me. Snarf's networking system is far from robust and complete. It's probably
  full of bugs, and although it works for maybe 85% of all current situations,
  I wouldn't base a library on it."</i>

</ul>

<b><a href="http://www.webdav.org/neon/">neon</a></b> (LGPL) <a href="neon.html">comparison with neon</a> <br>
<ul>
  An HTTP and WebDAV client library, with a C interface. I've mainly heard
  and seen people use this with WebDAV as their main interest. This is one
  of the two alternatives used by the Subversion project.
</ul>

<b><a href="ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/libsoup/">libsoup</a></b> (LGPL)  <a href="libsoup.html">comparison with libcurl</a><br>
<ul>

 Part of glib (GNOME). Supports: HTTP 1.1, Persistent connections,
 Asynchronous DNS and transfers, Connection cache, Redirects, Basic, Digest,
 NTLM authentication, SSL with GnuTLS, Proxy support including SSL, POST
 data. Not portable. Lacks: cookie support, NTLM for proxies, GSS, gzip
 encoding, trailers in chunked responses, portability and more.

</ul>

<b><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/Necko">mozilla netlib</a></b> (MPL)<br>
<ul>
  Handles URLs, protocols, transports for the Mozilla browser.
</ul>

<b><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/projects/xpnet/">mozilla libxpnet</a></b> (MPL)<br>
<ul> Minimal download library targeted to be much smaller than the above
  mentioned netlib. HTTP and FTP support.
</ul>

<b><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/">wget</a></b> (GPL)<br>
<ul>
  While not a library at all, I've been told that people sometimes extract the
  network code from it and base their own hacks from there.
</ul>

<b><a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/lib/libfetch/">libfetch</a></b> (BSD)<br>
<ul>
 Does HTTP and FTP transfers (both ways), supports file: URLs, and an API for
 URL parsing. The utility <i>fetch</i> that is built on libfetch is an
 integral part of the <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> operating
 system.
</ul>

<b><a href="http://http-fetcher.sourceforge.net/">HTTP Fetcher</a></b>
(LGPL)<br> <ul> "<i>a small, robust, flexible library for downloading files
via HTTP using the GET method.</i>" </ul>

<b><a href="http://www.demailly.com/~dl/wwwtools.html#http-tiny">http-tiny</a></b> (Artistic License)<br>
<ul>
"<i>a very small C library to make http queries (GET, HEAD, PUT, DELETE, etc.) easily portable and embeddable</i>"
</ul>

<b><a
href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa385483.aspx">wininet</a></b> <a
href="wininet.html">comparison with libcurl</a><br>

<ul>
  <i>"The Windows Internet (WinINet) application programming interface (API)
  enables applications to interact with Gopher, FTP, and HTTP protocols to
  access Internet resources."</i>
</ul>

<b><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/xmlsdk30/htm/xmobjxmlhttprequest.asp">XMLHTTP Object</a></b> also known as IXMLHTTPRequest (part of MSXML 3.0)<br>
<ul>
 (Windows) Provides client-side protocol support for communication with HTTP
 servers. A client computer can use the XMLHTTP object to send an arbitrary
 HTTP request, receive the response, and have the MicrosoftÂ® XML Document
 Object Model (DOM) parse that response.
</ul>

<b><a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qhttp.html">QHttp</a></b> (GPL)<br>
<ul>
 QHttp is a class in the Qt library from Troll Tech. Seems to be restricted
 to plain HTTP. Supports GET, POST and proxy. Asynchronous.
</ul>

<b><a href="http://nbpfaus.net/~pfau/ftplib/">ftplib</a></b> (GPL)
<ul>
 "<i>a set of routines that implement the FTP protocol. They allow
 applications to create and access remote files through function calls instead
 of needing to fork and exec an interactive ftp client program."</i>
<br>
 I stopped using it because it did not evolve and the maintainer did not even
 answer to my e-mailed patches and forum posts. The web site seems abandoned
 and the forum is not reachable anymore. It is simpler to use than libcurl,
 because it is not based on callbacks. But is is also much less powerful. / <a

</ul>

<b><a href="http://kasablanca.berlios.de/ftplibpp/">ftplib++</a></b> (GPL)
<ul>

 and downloads, FXP support, SSL/TLS encryption, and logging functionality."
</ul>

<b><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/commoncpp/">GNU Common C++ library</a></b>
<ul>
Has a URLStream class. This C++ class allow you to download a file using HTTP.

<b><a href="http://www.gnetlibrary.org/">gnetlibrary</a></b> (LGPL)

  <i>"a simple network library. It is written in C, object-oriented, and built
  upon GLib. It is intended to be easy to use and port"</i>. Features a HTTP
  component. It uses glib, and integrates very well within Gtk+ applications,
  which require event-driven programming.
</ul>

<b><a href="https://code.google.com/p/serf/">Serf</a></b> (Apache License)
<ul>
  <i>"The serf library is a C-based HTTP client library built upon the Apache

 Have <b>you</b> tried programming with one of the other libs and care share
your experiences? We'd love to make this collection more complete and feature
lengthier comments about each lib.
