<ul>

 <li> libcurl is (far) more portable

 <li> libsoup lacks support for: NTLM for proxies (Proxy-Authentication:),
 GSS, trailers in chunked responses, OpenSSL

 <li> libsoup offers server-side support

 <li> libsoup is using GNOME-related libs, making it a less convenient choice
 for non-GNOME environments.

 <li> SOCKS support has been removed from libsoup

</ul>

<i>"I found that libsoup is far slower than libcurl.  It uses at least 4x the
amount of CPU to transfer a high-bitrate datastream over HTTP.  I attribute
this to the over-reliance on heavy-weight glib/gobject constructs.  Man, that
stuff is slow *and* a pain to use!"</i> - [name withdrawn]
