 How we intend/hope this project to proceed:

SUBTITLE(1. Measure and Benchmark Existing API)
<p>
<ol>
<li> gather <i>many</i> unique existing URLs (a lot more than 10,000)
<ul>
<li> mostly to unique hosts, but not necessarily all unique. For the sake of
     comparing with a future pipelining version, the test script should be
     able to ask for the same document Y times, at least in a later stage.

<li> Write up a curl-using script and use these services:<br>
      http://randomurl.com/body.php<br>
      http://random.yahoo.com/fast/ryl<br>
      http://www.uroulette.com/visit

<li> Store the tens of thousands of random URLs in a text file

</ul>
<p>

<li> Write up a multi interface using program that extracts N random URLs from
   the list and downloads them simultaneously.
 <p>
   The random seed and N must be able to be specified to be able to repeat the
   exact same set in a subsequent invoke, but in general testing we must vary
   the seed in order to not exhaust the same hosts.
 <p>
   libcurl should most likely be built with c-ares support.
 <p>
   Use debug builds to be able to generated memory-trace logs to fully track
   and check amount of memory used per connection.
 <p>
   Compare the memory usage measurements with the amount of memory installed
   in the development machines so that we remain testing within the amount of
   available system RAM.

<li> Measure time from select() returning to it being called again. Run
    multiple times - do many measurements.
</ol>

SUBTITLE(2. Implement the curl_multi_socket API)
<p>
  - Port the test program from phase 1 to the new API.
<p>
  - Run measurements and benchmarks

SUBTITLE(3. Implement HTTP pipelining support)
<p>
   Make sure that:
<ul>
<li> the test program enables pipelining

<li> the test program talks to a fair amount of servers that support pipelining

<li> a fair amount of documents are fetched from the same servers so that
    pipelining actually can get activated
</ul>
<p>
   To make benchmarks, identify high-latency high-bandwith servers that allow
   pipelining to get a feel for "optimal" performance boosts.
