TITLE(PHP/CURL -- using libcurl with PHP)
<p>
 Get libcurl functionality straight from within your PHP programs. PHP/CURL is
 supported built-in since PHP 4.0.2, no extra stuff is needed but PHP and
 libcurl installed.
</p>

<p>
 PHP/CURL is a binding that uses libcurl. It means that the PHP team has
 written a glue layer for PHP that speaks to the underlying libcurl. That
 layer, the binding, is what we call PHP/CURL and that is what offers the
 functions named curl_* within the PHP language for you. The PHP/CURL binding
 is written, maintained and being provided by the PHP team and you <b>will
 not</b> find any binaries, DLLs or other packages for it on this site.
