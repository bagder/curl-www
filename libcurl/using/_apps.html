 We <i>used</i> to keep a list here, showing 100+ programs that use
 libcurl.

<p>
 It turned out to be too tedious to keep the links alive and information
 relevant so we decided to stop trying. Thousands of applications use libcurl
 these days, it is too hard to keep track.

#if 0

 An incomplete list of applications that use libcurl. There are many more out
 there. Many applications are also built on top of various libcurl bindings,
 and they are not included here. Mail <a href="mailto:curl-web at
 haxx.se">curl-web</a> to get added to this list.
