SUBTITLE(Contents)
<p>
 These snapshots are generated straight from git every euro morning. Snapshots
 are kept a few weeks before deleted.

<p>
 The <b>docs/RELEASE-TOOLS.md</b> document is bundled in every snapshot,
 showing the tooling needed to reproduce the snapshot tarball. This is not
 necessarily the same set of tools+versions as official curl releases use,
 because these snapshots are generated automatically on a different host.

<p> Since August 2024, every snapshot contains a file named
 <b>docs/tarball-commit.txt</b> that contains the commit hash that was the
 HEAD at the time the tarball is made.

SUBTITLE(Extensions)
<p>
<ul>
<li> <b>tar.bz2</b> is the source tar archive bzip2 compressed
<li> <b>zip</b> is the source archive zip compressed
<li> <b>tar.xz</b> is the source tar archive xz compressed
