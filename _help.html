<p>
 The curl project depends on voluntary work by skilled people. We depend on
 work by many different people for this to develop. Time and resources are
 scarce for all of us, of course, so if we share the burden we can reach
 further and create a better product. This list contains some of the stuff we
 need help with right now.
